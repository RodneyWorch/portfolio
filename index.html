              <h1>About me!</h1></br>
              <p>I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. Growing up I have always been fond of music, photography, and especially enjoyed the outdoors. I finished high school and started taking classes at Salt lake Community College. After a year and a half I decided that I would take some time off and travel to Alaska for the summer. With very little money in my pocket I found a job at a fish processing plant in Nek Nek, Alaska where i worked for 3 weeks and made enough money to make it through the summer. I ended up backpacking and camping across the state of Alaska and into the Yukon territory of Canada. When it came time to come home, I couldn't bring myself to it. I ended up moving to a small town 35 miles Southeast of Anchorage by the name of Girdwood where I lived for the next 10 years.</p>
